    "# Generalized Cellular Automata Test\n",
    "The goal of this project is to experiment with a new paradigm for generalized intelligence, inspired heavily by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-OYPRhqRCg) talk between Joscha Bach and Michael Levin. The ideas I'm drawing upon are primarily Bachs, however I take heavy inspiration by Levins work on collective intelligence in all forms of cells as well, seeking originally to make one based mostly on the idea of bioelectric signaling, and slowly shifting more towards Joscha Bachs idea on a search for selector_functions to find appropraite neighbors in higher dimensions to process information over long distances."

    "# Random ideas\n",
    "* Now that we have the cellular automata engine, it's time to make it think. The basic idea is to have it's selector function decide which neighbors it looks for, probably up to the maximum of 8 it coulde have around it spatially. We can intialize them entirely randomly, or simply start with it's base neighbors.\n",
    "* To get useful inputs and outputs, we need to have certain neurons represent inputs, and others represent outputs. For instance, we could encode some information in the continuous value of input neurons, with more neurons used for more complex information, and have the available actions mapped to certain outputs (ideally these outputs would be more arbitary and less hard-coded somehow in the future).\n",
    "* The learning mechanism will be reward driven using an economic distribution sort of appraoch similar to the suggestions given by Joscha Bach in the Generalist AI talk between Joscha Bach and Michael Levin. We will attempt to track how much each neuron contributes to the final reward.\n",
    "* Input neurons would be rewarded more for keeping the input information to encourage the system to keep the information.\n",
    "* A basic training test we can imagine is a simple addition algorithm. For instance, we can create a simple 4 bit adder. To do so, we will have 2 sets of 4 cell inputs, and one set of a 4 bit output with a carry output.\n",
    "* If a cell is negatively contributing to the loss function (or whatever metric we use to evaluate the result), cells will weaken their connection to it and eventually seek new neighbors, and if they're positively contributing cells will strengthen their connection. This can draw on the cells memory in some fashion as well.\n",
    "* If a cell is itself negatively contributing to the loss function, it will randomly seek new neighbors in a hope to eventually contribute.\n",
    "* Unlike a traditional neural net which would be trained and then ran in inference, the training of this automata would be continuously ongoing. I'll need to add ways to interact with it live to help test how resistant it is to perturbations over time and learning entirely new tasks within the network, for isntance starting with a 2 bit adder, upping it to 4, upping that to 8, etc.\n",
    "* Since information would take time to propagate through the network and calculate (unless there was somehow direct connections to the task, but in practice the tasks should be too complex for such simple connections), the method by which rewards are propagated through the network should probably be analyzed every x steps or something of the sort. The memory could in theory play some sort of part in this, and in general it seems to line up with my recent thoughts on the importance of brain-wave like patterns in intelligence in general. This could in practice mean we can give a new input and read the output every x steps, say 10, making the network have an effective processing time of x steps * time per step."
