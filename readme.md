# Generalized Cellular Automata Test

The goal of this project is to experiment with a new paradigm for generalized intelligence, inspired heavily by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-OYPRhqRCg) talk between Joscha Bach and Michael Levin. 

The ideas I'm drawing upon are primarily Bachs, however I take heavy inspiration by Levins work on collective intelligence in all forms of cells as well, seeking originally to make one based mostly on the idea of bioelectric signaling, and slowly shifting more towards Joscha Bachs idea on a search for selector functions to find appropraite neighbors in higher dimensions to process information over long distances.

By allowing the rules of each cell to evolve to search for different neighbors to link with, and by measuring the contribution of each cell towards a total desired output (allowing for x time steps to calculate an answer, essentially the hz at which it can think), a network that is able to solve novel goals could potentially manifest. The biggest problem with this approach will be finding something better than random search, as otherwise the search space becomes quadratically more expensive to arrive to a working solution.
